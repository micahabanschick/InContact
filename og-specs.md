# Requirements:

[x] The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible

[x] Use the create-react-app generator to start your project.

[x] Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: create-react-app

[x] Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application

[x] There should be 5 stateless components

[x] There should be 3 routes

[x] The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs; docs for v4 can be found here)

[x] Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change

[x] Make use of async actions and redux-thunk middleware to send data to and receive data from a server

[x] Your Rails API should handle the data persistence with a database. You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.

[x] Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation

[x] Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!

[x] Once your app is complete, fill out this checklist.

[x] Go wild! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like.
